## üßæ Project Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes **India‚Äôs 2024 Election Results** using **SQL** for data processing and **Power BI** for interactive dashboards.  
It reveals insights on **party performance**, **winning margins**, **vote share**, and **regional strengths**.

---

## üìÇ Data Source

The dataset includes:
- Candidate names and parties  
- Total votes received  
- Constituency and state details  
- Winner and runner-up information  

Data was initially in **CSV/Excel** format and imported into **SQL** for analysis.

---

## üß† SQL Workflow

### ü™ú Steps Performed in SQL

1. **Data Import**  
   - Imported the dataset into SQL tables using `LOAD DATA INFILE` or `INSERT INTO`.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed duplicates and null entries using `DISTINCT`, `DELETE`, and `COALESCE()`.  
   - Standardized column names and text formatting using `TRIM()` and `UPPER()`.

3. **Data Transformation**  
   - Created new calculated fields for **vote share** and **margin**.  
   - Used **joins** to merge Candidate, Party, and Constituency data.  
   - Implemented **window functions** (`RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`) to identify winners.

4. **Data Analysis**  
   - Aggregated total votes by party and state.  
   - Calculated **percentage margins** and **ranking**.  
   - Exported cleaned data to Power BI for visualization.

## üß© SQL Queries (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced)

### üü¢ Basic Queries

| **Purpose** | **SQL Query** | **Functions / Concepts** | **Description** |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Total Votes by Party | ```sql SELECT party_name, SUM(total_votes) AS Total_Votes FROM election_data GROUP BY party_name ORDER BY Total_Votes DESC; ``` | `SUM()`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY` | Summarizes total votes secured by each party. |
| List Candidates by Constituency | ```sql SELECT constituency_name, candidate_name, party_name FROM election_data ORDER BY constituency_name; ``` | `ORDER BY` | Lists all candidates contesting in each constituency. |
| Constituency Count per State | ```sql SELECT state_name, COUNT(DISTINCT constituency_name) AS Total_Seats FROM election_data GROUP BY state_name; ``` | `COUNT(DISTINCT)` | Counts the total constituencies per state. |

---

### üü° Intermediate Queries

| **Purpose** | **SQL Query** | **Functions / Concepts** | **Description** |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Winner per Constituency | ```sql SELECT constituency_name, candidate_name AS Winner, party_name, MAX(total_votes) AS Votes FROM election_data GROUP BY constituency_name; ``` | `MAX()`, `GROUP BY` | Identifies top-voted candidates per constituency. |
| State-wise Party Performance | ```sql SELECT state_name, party_name, SUM(total_votes) AS Total_Votes FROM election_data GROUP BY state_name, party_name ORDER BY state_name, Total_Votes DESC; ``` | `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY` | Displays party performance per state. |
| Vote Share per Candidate | ```sql SELECT constituency_name, candidate_name, (total_votes * 100.0 / SUM(total_votes) OVER (PARTITION BY constituency_name)) AS Vote_Percentage FROM election_data; ``` | `SUM() OVER()`, `PARTITION BY` | Calculates candidate‚Äôs vote share per constituency. |

---

### üî¥ Advanced Queries

| **Purpose** | **SQL Query** | **Functions / Concepts** | **Description** |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Winner vs Runner-up with Margin | ```sql SELECT A.constituency_name, A.candidate_name AS Winner, B.candidate_name AS Runner_Up, (A.total_votes - B.total_votes) AS Margin FROM (SELECT *, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY constituency_name ORDER BY total_votes DESC) AS rnk FROM election_data) A JOIN (SELECT *, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY constituency_name ORDER BY total_votes DESC) AS rnk FROM election_data) B ON A.constituency_name = B.constituency_name WHERE A.rnk = 1 AND B.rnk = 2; ``` | `RANK()`, `JOIN`, `PARTITION BY` | Finds the top 2 candidates and computes their vote margin. |
| Party with Highest Winning Margin | ```sql SELECT party_name, MAX(total_votes - LAG(total_votes) OVER (PARTITION BY constituency_name ORDER BY total_votes DESC)) AS Highest_Margin FROM election_data GROUP BY party_name ORDER BY Highest_Margin DESC; ``` | `LAG()`, `OVER()`, `MAX()` | Finds which party achieved the largest winning margin. |
| Comparative Vote Analysis | ```sql SELECT constituency_name, SUM(CASE WHEN party_name = 'PartyA' THEN total_votes ELSE 0 END) AS PartyA_Votes, SUM(CASE WHEN party_name = 'PartyB' THEN total_votes ELSE 0 END) AS PartyB_Votes FROM election_data GROUP BY constituency_name; ``` | `CASE WHEN`, `SUM()` | Compares votes between two parties in each constituency. |

## üìä Power BI Workflow (Step-by-Step)

1. **Data Connection**  
   - Connected Power BI to SQL database.  
   - Imported tables: `Candidate`, `Party`, `Constituency`, `ElectionResults`.

2. **Data Cleaning (Power Query)**  
   - Removed nulls, duplicates, and renamed columns.  
   - Ensured correct data types for all numeric fields.

3. **Data Modeling**  
   - Established relationships between tables:  
     - `ElectionResults[party_id] ‚Üí Party[party_id]`  
     - `ElectionResults[candidate_id] ‚Üí Candidate[candidate_id]`  
     - `ElectionResults[constituency_id] ‚Üí Constituency[constituency_id]`  
   - Built a **Star Schema** for efficiency.

4. **DAX Measures**  
   - `Total Votes = SUM(ElectionResults[votes])`  
   - `Vote Share % = DIVIDE(SUM(ElectionResults[votes]), CALCULATE(SUM(ElectionResults[votes]), ALLEXCEPT(ElectionResults, ElectionResults[Constituency]))) * 100`  
   - `Winning Margin = [Top Candidate Votes] - [Runner-up Votes]`  
   - `Seats Won = DISTINCTCOUNT(Winning Constituencies)`

5. **Dashboard Design**  
   - **Bar Chart:** Party-wise total votes  
   - **Pie Chart:** Vote share percentage  
   - **Map Visual:** State-wise party performance  
   - **Table Visual:** Candidate-wise detailed view  
   - Added **slicers** for Year, Party, and State.

6. **Formatting & Publishing**  
   - Added tooltips, color themes, and data labels.  
   - Published final dashboard to **Power BI Service** for sharing.

2. üìä **Vote Share Patterns:** Revealed clear dominance regions for major parties.  
3. ‚öñÔ∏è **Close Contests:** Highlighted constituencies where the margin < 1000 votes.  
4. üó∫Ô∏è **State-Level Trends:** Displayed which parties led in specific regions.  
5. üìà **Performance Comparison:** Tracked vote growth and losses compared to previous elections (if data available).  
6. üí¨ **Interactive Dashboard:** Enabled users to explore data dynamically through Power BI filters.
