## Project Overview

This repository contains code, SQL scripts, and Power BI files to analyze election results data (e.g. vote counts, constituencies, parties, candidates). The goal is to clean, transform, and model the data, and then visualize insights such as:

- Total votes per party, per constituency  
- Trends over time (if multi-year)  
- Comparative performance  
- Maps / geographical visualizations (if available)  

---

## Data Source

- Original raw data (CSV, Excel, or other) containing election results by constituency, candidates, party, votes, etc.  
- Metadata (e.g. constituency names, region, party lookup tables)  
- Any lookup tables or reference data used  

*Note: Ensure that any private or sensitive data is handled appropriately.*

## Database / SQL Workflow

Below is an outline of the steps in the SQL / database side of the project:

### Schema / Tables

You might have tables such as:

- `Constituency` (constituency_id, name, state, region, etc.)  
- `Party` (party_id, name, abbreviation, etc.)  
- `Candidate` (candidate_id, name, party_id, etc.)  
- `ElectionResult` (result_id, constituency_id, candidate_id, votes, year, etc.)  
- Lookup or dimension tables as needed  

### ETL / Data Cleaning / Ingestion

1. **Load raw data** — import CSV or Excel files into staging tables.  
2. **Clean data** — handle missing values, correct data types, trim whitespace, unify naming conventions.  
3. **Transform** — join with lookup tables (e.g. map party names to party_id), compute derived columns (vote share, ranking, margins).  
4. **Load into final schema** — populate the normalized tables (Constituency, Party, Candidate, ElectionResult).  
5. **Indexing / constraints** — add primary keys, foreign keys, indexes for query performance.

### Sample Queries & Analyses

Here are examples of queries you might use:

- **Total votes per party in a state**  
  ```sql
  SELECT p.name AS party_name, SUM(er.votes) AS total_votes
  FROM ElectionResult er
    JOIN Candidate c ON er.candidate_id = c.candidate_id
    JOIN Party p ON c.party_id = p.party_id
    JOIN Constituency co ON er.constituency_id = co.constituency_id
  WHERE co.state = 'Maharashtra'
  GROUP BY p.name
  ORDER BY total_votes DESC;
